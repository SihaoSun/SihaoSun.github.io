However, their agility is not fully exploited, owning to the immaturity of flight algorithms. This project aims at further excavating the potential of drones to achieve their maximum agility, which is highly beneficial for time-critical missions such as search and rescue.\nSo far, we have made a thorough comparative study of the two most promising control approaches for agile drone flights: the differential-flatness-based controller (sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s referred to as the geometric control), and the nonlinear model predictive control. This study shows that both methods have the ability to track agile trajectories with 20m/s top speed and 5g acceleration. But the nonlinear model predictive control shows better performance when tracking many dynamically infeasible trajectories.\nWe also propose a nonlinear model predictive contouring controller (MPCC) for agile drone flights. Unlike the above two state-of-the-art methods, this control approach does not need an off-line generated time-optimal trajectory encoding full states of a quadrotor. Instead, it can follow arbitrary 3D paths in a near-time-optimal manner. These 3D paths can be splines, or time-optimal trajectories computed using a reduced model, which can be effectively generated online to be adaptive against environment uncertainties. Thanks to this property, our method achieves a decent trade-off between robustness and performance during agile flights in cluttered environments. (Check our video)\nModel uncertainties, especially from complex aerodynamic effects, are another major threat to flying safety and degrades the performance in agile flights. For this, we proposed a nonlinear model predictive control framework combining the L1 adaptive control (L1-NMPC). Extensive flight experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has high robustness against different types of model uncertainties, including mismatch in the inertial properties, slosh payload (like a beer!), and complex aerodynamic effects.

This project aims at introducing novel flight control methods to mitigate the consequence of in-flight motor failures, which rarely happens but is still a big safety threat after large scale deployment of drones in the future.\nTo be specific, the project leverages incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control method, to stabilize and control a quadrotor with failure of a single rotor or two opposing rotors, under significant aerodynamic disturbances. These strong aerodynamic effects are dominant in high-speed flight, or windy conditions. Thanks to the robustness of the INDI controller, the damaged quadrotor maintains controllable in spite of these aeordynamic disturbances.\nWe have validated the proposed controllers in a large scale wind tunnel, named Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. Despite a complete loss of one or two propellers, the tested quadrotor can maintain high-speed flight. In addition to validating the controller, these wind tunnel flight tests have produced valuable data for identifying aerodynamic models of a quadrotor, in both nominal and damaged conditions.\nAnother focus of the research aims at recovering the damaged quadrotor after motor failure. When a motor failure is detected, a quadrotor might have been entered a detrimental flight condition, such as an upside-down orientation, where the drone can hardly recover to stable flights using the state-of-art methods. Therefore, we have developed an upset recovery controller, using a novel control allocation approach. We have explored the performance of using nonlienar model predictive controller (NMPC) on the upset recovery task. The fail-safe performance is mind blowing. It is able to recover the quadrotor after motor failure not only from extreme orientations, but also from agile flights.\nAbove research, all rely on external sensors to provide reliable state estimates of the damaged quadrotor. This is a strong assumption in real-world scenarios where motion capture systems are not available and GPS signals can be degraded. For this reason, we have explored using onboard vision sensors to provide a full-state estimation of the drone with motor failures. The high-speed yaw motion makes it challenging to use a vision-based estimator as it brings motion blur. Hence we have conducted a research project to explore the potential of using standard frame-based cameras and event-based cameras on quadrotor fail-safe tasks.
