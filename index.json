This project aims at introducing novel flight control methods to mitigate the consequence of in-flight motor failures, which rarely happens but is still a big safety threat after large scale deployment of drones in the future.\nTo be specific, the project leverages incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control method, to stabilize and control a quadrotor with failure of a single rotor or two opposing rotors, under significant aerodynamic disturbances. These strong aerodynamic effects are dominant in high-speed flight, or windy conditions. Thanks to the robustness of the INDI controller, the damaged quadrotor maintains controllable in spite of these aeordynamic disturbances.\nWe have validated the proposed controllers in a large scale wind tunnel, named Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. Despite a complete loss of one or two propellers, the tested quadrotor can maintain high-speed flight. In addition to validating the controller, these wind tunnel flight tests have produced valuable data for identifying aerodynamic models of a quadrotor, in both nominal and damaged conditions.\nAnother focus of the research aims at recovering the damaged quadrotor after motor failure. When a motor failure is detected, a quadrotor might have been entered a detrimental flight condition, such as an upside-down orientation, where the drone can hardly recover to stable flights using the state-of-art methods. Therefore, we have developed an upset recovery controller, using a novel control allocation approach.\n","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"7c64e3cfdcbc41d48612c59559a549d3","permalink":"https://SihaoSun.github.io/project/quadrotorftc/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quadrotorftc/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, we design a set of fault-tolerant control algorithms to stabilize and control a quadrotor with complete loss of one or more rotors in realistic scenarios, such as withstanding significant unmodeled aerodynamic effects in high-speed flights.","tags":["Fault Tolerant Flight Control"],"title":"Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Flight Control","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sihao Sun","Coen de Visser"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To this end, we have conducted flight tests of a quadrotor in a large scale wind tunnel, namely Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. As a first research outcome, we have obtained a high-speed applicable gray-box model capturing dominant aerodynamic effects (such as blade-flapping, thrust variation) as well as minor effects (e.g., rotor-body wake interactions, aerodynamic moments).\nAfter designing some novel fault-tolerant flight controllers, we have conducted a wind tunnel flight test of a high-speed spinning quadrotor with the complete failure of one or two rotors. Using these flight data, we have identified a more generalized aerodynamic force/moment model, with very few parameters. This model can be either applied to a quadrotor without failure or with the complete loss of a propeller.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"426171d6b82b3822c17267b1b95804e5","permalink":"https://SihaoSun.github.io/project/quadrotormodeling/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quadrotormodeling/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims at obtaining quadrotor aerodynamic model using system identification technique from high-speed flight data, which is obtained in the wind tunnel flights.","tags":["Aerodynamic Modeling"],"title":"Quadrotors Aerodynamic Modeling Identification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://SihaoSun.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
